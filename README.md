This repository contains a simple TypeScript program that demonstrates a common type error. The program defines a function `greeter` that takes a string argument and returns a string. However, when the function is called with an array of strings, a type error occurs because the function expects a string, but receives an array of strings. The solution demonstrates how to fix this error by ensuring that the function is called with a string argument.
